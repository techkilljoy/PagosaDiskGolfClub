------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Beautiful wooded course with full signage.
 Very technical, a variety of shots are necessary - 
 some short, some long. Signature holes are 12 and 18.
 Original tees are the Eagle course, New tees are Raven course. 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
RESERVOIR HILL COURSE PROS: This is a beautiful course set in a high elevation pine forest. 
Virtually all drives require hitting gaps in trees, and some of the holes are very tight. 
There is significant elevation change across the course, with Hole 12 being a signature downhill hole with over 100' of drop.
Good Chainstar baskets and excellent tee signs for both sets of tees.
This was already a great course, but the addition of a second set of tees (Raven tees) have made it even better. 
For me, the original tees (Eagle tees) are plenty challenging, and I was afraid that a more difficult second set would be 
too much for my game, but that's not the case. The Raven tees are generally about the same distance, but offset left or right to give a 
different line that is often a bit tighter. A few of the Raven tees add significant distance (77' on Hole 7, 84' on Hole 16), 
but the alternate tee on Hole 12 is actually 200' shorter, so it isn't all about distance. The Raven tee on Hole 2 is interesting in 
that it is oriented 90 degrees from the Eagle tee, creating a 90 degree dogleg right to the basket. 
 
RESERVOIR HILL COURSE CONS: The tee pads are natural dirt and can get pretty gummy and slick with rain. 
They are currently flat and well marked, but they can get rutted up with use.
The Chainstar baskets have no color band at the top, so can be tricky to spot on this well-shaded course. 
A local told me that the city fathers didn't want the Innova baskets with the big yellow band, 
as this is a multi-use park and they wanted to keep the baskets a bit more discrete. Fair enough...

RESERVOIR HILL COURSE LOCAL DIRECTIONS: From HWY 160 in downtown Pagosa Springs:
 Turn south onto Hot Springs Boulevard and after 0.3 mi,
 look for a sign with a symbol of a disc basket.
 Turn left (east) onto Spring Street and park in the gravel lot.
 From the lot, proceed on foot through the gate up a steep hill 
 and look for the first hole on the north side of the meadow 
 approximately one-quarter mile up the road or foot path 
 (road intersects foot path near the tees for #1 and #16). 
 --------------------------------------------------------------
CLOMAN PARK COURSE PROS AND CONS: No Reviews

CLOMAN PARK COURSE LOCAL DIRECTIONS: From HW 160 turn North on Piedra Blvd. 
Turn right on Cloman Blvd (Steven's Field airport sign). 
Cloman Blvd dead ends into Cloman Park parking lot. 
----------------------------------------------------------------
ASPEN SPRINGS COURSE PROS: If you've ever imagined a course placed in a large, open meadow, this is it. 
Most of the holes are straight drives to the basket with no obstructions or elevation difference. 
Holes 7 & 8 use elevation changes around a small drainage gully to add interest.
Signage is good and the baskets are in good shape as well, with the exception of a couple of broken chains. 
Teepads are simple rectangles where the sod has been removed. 

ASPEN SPRINGS COURSE CONS: No real variety on the course, with the exception of distance changes from hole-to-hole. 

ASPEN SPRINGS COURSE LOCAL DIRECTIONS: From Pagosa Springs:
Head west on US-160 for around 11 miles to a left on Hurt Dr. 
Follow it to the right and make a left to stay on Hurt Dr. 
Continue for .6 miles to a left on Ute Dr. 
Drive across valley and park at pavilion.
